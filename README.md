# Tweet Card

Tweet Card is a tool that allows you to create visually appealing Twitter profile cards that can be embedded on web pages or social media. With this tool, you can choose any Twitter account and create cards that include the user's profile picture, username, and tweet text.

The unique feature of this project is the "Follow" button, which changes to display the number of followers on the card after it's clicked. This feature is implemented using local storage, so the follower count is preserved even when the page is refreshed.
